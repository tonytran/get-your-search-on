President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama meet at the White House.
(Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency)

After reiterating his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,
President-elect Donald Trump [has
indicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-and-aides-hedge-on-
major-pledges-including-obamacare-and-the-
wall/2016/11/11/9196b364-a82f-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-
top-table-main_lede-desktoponly%3Ahomepage%2Fstory) that he may keep two of
the law’s most popular provisions. One is straightforward enough — children up
to the age of 26 being allowed to stay on their parents’ plan. The other —
preventing insurance companies from denying coverage because of preexisting
conditions — offers a perfect illustration of why Trump and most of the other
Republicans critics of Obamacare don’t understand the health insurance market.

Let’s say that in the beautiful new world of “repeal and replace,” insurers
are required to sell you insurance despite the fact that your kid has a brain
tumor. Insurance companies know what to do with that. Their actuaries can
calculate that kids with brain tumors typically require (I’m making this
number up) about $200,000 a year in medical care. So they’ll offer to sell you
a policy at an annual premium of $240,000.

_ [[Donald Trump and the end of
history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/11/donald-trump-
and-the-end-of-history/)] _

At this point your response will probably be that such an outcome is not fair.
When the law says insurance companies can’t discriminate on the basis for pre-
existing conditions, surely what it means is that they have to charge roughly
the same price for health insurance, irrespective of your pre-existing
condition. In the language of insurance, that’s called “guaranteed issue at
community rates.”

Unfortunately, in the states that have tried guaranteed issues at community
rates, the insurance markets have collapsed. That’s because if you guarantee
everyone the right to buy health insurance at community rates, then some
consumers will game the system. The young and healthy ones won’t buy any
health insurance at all—they’ll go without until they are diagnosed with
diabetes or a brain tumor or get hit by a truck crossing the street. And when
that happens, they will immediately call up Aetna or Anthem and exercise their
right to buy health insurance at the low community rate, irrespective of their
medical condition. It won’t be long before insurance companies begin losing a
ton of money and are forced either to raise premiums through the roof or stop
writing policies altogether.

_ [[A new theory for why Trump voters are so angry — that actually makes
sense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/a-new-theory-
for-why-trump-voters-are-so-angry-that-actually-makes-sense/)] _

So how do you prevent that kind of gaming of the system by consumers? Well,
that’s easy. You require that everyone buy at least some minimal level of
insurance at the beginning of every year, so they can’t buy insurance only
after they get sick. Let’s call that an” individual mandate.” But because you
can’t expect poor people to pay $1,000 a month, they will require subsidies to
keep their out-of-pocket costs to something like 10 percent of income. To pay
for the subsidies, a new tax will be required.

So let’s review what just happened. To guarantee that people with pre-existing
conditions can get affordable health insurance, you need to have rules
requiring guaranteed issue and community rating. To keep insurance companies
in business because of guaranteed issue and community rating, you need to have
an individual mandate. And because poor people can’t afford health insurance,
you need subsidies. Combine all three, and what you have, in a nutshell, is
... Obamacare.

Yes, it’s a bit more complicated than that, but not much. It’s possible to
allow insurance companies charge twice or three times as much, to people who
are older or sicker. You can let healthy people buy somewhat more barebones
“catastrophic” policies to satisfying their obligation under the individual
mandate. You could even avoid community rating by sending sick people into
“high risk pools” where their premiums would be subsidized by a tax on
everyone else’s health care premiums.

But at the end of the day, once you decide that everyone, regardless of age or
medical condition, should be able to buy health insurance at an affordable
price, you have essentially bought into the idea that young and healthy people
have an obligation to subsidize the older and sicker people in some fashion.
And once you do that, it’s sort of inevitable you end up where every health
reform plan has ended up since the days of Richard Nixon. You end up with some
variation on Obamacare.

_ [[A new sign Republicans will give Donald Trump the same pass they gave
Bush](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/republicans-look-
like-they-could-change-their-tune-on-debt-under-a-president-trump/)] _

Of course, if you want to scrap guaranteed issue, scrap community rating,
scrap the individual mandate and scrap the subsidies, as Republicans, propose,
then you end up where the country was in 2008—with a market system that
inevitable gives way to an insurance spiral in which steadily rising premiums
cause a steadily rising percentage of Americans without health insurance.

There are no easy solutions here, no free lunches. You can’t have all the good
parts of an unregulated insurance market (freedom to buy what you want, when
you want, with market pricing) without the bad parts (steadily rising premiums
and insurance that is unaffordable for people who are old and sick).

At the same time, you can’t have all the good parts of a socialized system
(universal coverage at affordable prices) without freedom-reducing mandates
and regulations and large doses of subsidies from some people to other people.
Anyone who says otherwise – anyone promising better quality health care at
lower cost with fewer regulations and lower taxes—is peddling hokum.

Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,
otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the
presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not
prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The
